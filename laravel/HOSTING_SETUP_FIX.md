# URGENT: Laravel Hosting Setup Fix

## Problem Identified
The Laravel project was not uploaded correctly to hosting. Critical files are missing because the file structure is wrong.

## Current Issue
Your hosting shows these files are missing:
- Main entry point (index.php)
- Composer autoloader
- Laravel bootstrap
- All Laravel core files

## Solution: Proper Laravel Hosting Upload

### Step 1: Understand Hosting Structure
Most shared hosting has this structure:
```
/public_html/ (or /www/ or /htdocs/) <- This is your domain's public folder
/home/username/ <- This is your account's root folder
```

### Step 2: Correct Upload Method

#### Option A: Standard Shared Hosting Setup (Recommended)
1. **Upload Laravel files to account root** (NOT public_html):
   ```
   /home/username/laravel/
   ├── app/
   ├── bootstrap/
   ├── config/
   ├── database/
   ├── public/
   ├── resources/
   ├── routes/
   ├── storage/
   ├── vendor/
   ├── .env
   ├── artisan
   └── composer.json
   ```

2. **Copy public folder contents to public_html**:
   Copy everything from `/laravel/public/` to `/public_html/`

3. **Update index.php in public_html**:
   Edit the paths in `/public_html/index.php`:
   ```php
   require __DIR__.'/../laravel/vendor/autoload.php';
   $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../laravel/bootstrap/app.php';
   ```

#### Option B: All Files in Public (Less Secure)
If your hosting only allows files in public_html:
1. Upload ALL Laravel files to `/public_html/`
2. No path changes needed
3. Less secure but works

### Step 3: Create Proper .env File
Create `/laravel/.env` (or `/public_html/.env` if using Option B):
```env
APP_NAME="Event Tiket"
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:GENERATE_THIS_KEY
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://dua.niemaggg.space

LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=error

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=local
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
```

### Step 4: Run Setup Commands
Access your hosting's file manager or SSH and run:
```bash
cd /path/to/laravel
php artisan key:generate
php artisan storage:link
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

### Step 5: Set File Permissions
```bash
chmod -R 755 storage/
chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache/
chmod 644 .env
```

## Quick Fix for Your Current Situation

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Re-upload the entire Laravel project** using the correct method above
2. **Don't just upload to public_html** - use the proper structure
3. **Create the .env file** with your database settings
4. **Run the setup commands**

### Files You Need to Upload:
- All Laravel framework files (app/, bootstrap/, config/, etc.)
- vendor/ folder (all Composer dependencies)
- .env file with correct settings
- public/ folder contents to your domain's public folder

## Why This Happened
The troubleshoot.php shows missing files because:
1. Laravel core files weren't uploaded
2. File structure is incorrect for hosting
3. Paths in index.php don't match hosting structure

## Next Steps
1. Follow the upload instructions above
2. Create proper .env file
3. Run the setup commands
4. Test the website

The website will work once the files are uploaded correctly with the proper hosting structure.
