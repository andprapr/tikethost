# Return Rule Implementation - Test Documentation

## Overview
The return rule has been successfully implemented. Once a ticket number has been claimed, it will automatically expire and cannot be used again. The status in the admin manage-ticket interface will show "Ticket claimed."

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes

#### TicketController.php
- **New Method**: `claimTicket()` - Handles ticket claiming and expiration
- **Updated Method**: `validateTicket()` - Enhanced error message for claimed tickets
- **Security**: Validates session and prevents unauthorized claims
- **Automatic Expiration**: Marks ticket as `is_used = true` and clears session

#### Key Features:
- Session validation to ensure only valid ticket holders can claim
- One-time claim enforcement (ticket becomes unusable after claim)
- Automatic session cleanup after claim
- Clear error messages for invalid/claimed tickets

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Home View (home.blade.php)
- **New Function**: `claimTicket()` - AJAX call to claim endpoint
- **Integration**: Automatic claim when user selects a gift box
- **User Experience**: Seamless claiming process during gift selection
- **Session Management**: Clears localStorage after successful claim

#### Admin Interface Updates
- **Tickets View**: Status shows "Ticket claimed" instead of "Terpakai"
- **Dashboard**: Statistics updated to show "Ticket Claimed"
- **Consistency**: All admin interfaces use the new terminology

### 3. Route Configuration
- **Route**: `POST /ticket/claim` → `TicketController@claimTicket`
- **Name**: `ticket.claim`
- **Middleware**: Web middleware (includes CSRF protection)

## Testing Results

### Current System State
- Total Tickets: 10
- Sample Tickets Available:
  - TKT028350 (Prize: motor) - Active
  - TKT146172 (Prize: Uang Tunai) - Active
  - TKT762709 (Prize: motor) - Active

### Functionality Verification
✅ Ticket status can be changed from Active to Claimed
✅ Database updates work correctly
✅ Admin interface shows proper status
✅ Routes are properly configured
✅ No syntax errors in code

## User Flow

### Normal Ticket Usage:
1. User enters valid ticket code
2. System validates ticket (must be unused)
3. User selects a gift box
4. System automatically claims the ticket
5. Ticket status changes to "Ticket claimed"
6. Ticket becomes permanently unusable

### Admin View:
1. Admin accesses manage-tickets interface
2. Sees tickets with status:
   - "Aktif" (Active) - Can still be used
   - "Ticket claimed" - Has been used and expired
3. Statistics show count of claimed tickets

## Security Features

### Claim Protection:
- Session validation required
- CSRF token protection
- Prevents double-claiming
- Automatic session cleanup

### Validation Enhancement:
- Clear error messages for claimed tickets
- Prevents reuse of expired tickets
- Session-based access control

## Return Rule Compliance

✅ **One-time Use**: Tickets can only be claimed once
✅ **Automatic Expiration**: Tickets expire immediately after claim
✅ **Admin Visibility**: Status shows "Ticket claimed" in admin interface
✅ **Prevention of Reuse**: Claimed tickets cannot be validated again
✅ **User Feedback**: Clear messages about ticket status

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Database:
- Uses existing `is_used` boolean field
- No schema changes required
- Maintains data integrity

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /ticket/claim` - Claims and expires ticket
- Enhanced validation in existing endpoints

### Frontend Integration:
- Automatic claiming during gift selection
- Real-time status updates
- Improved user experience

The return rule implementation is complete and functional. Tickets are now single-use only and automatically expire upon claiming, with clear status indication in the admin interface.
